Download the relevant bands of cloud-free (&lt; 5% cloud cover) Sentinel-2 imagery using API (do not download directly) considering the NCR (national capital region) area as an AOI (use an admin boundary or approximate area) for the time
period from 2015-2022 for the month of December.
Monthly composite for each year (using max as a statistics) and calculate NDVI & NDWI using these monthly composite (should have 8 images for each index) and A simple yearly plot for each index doing spatial averaging for the entire
AOI.
